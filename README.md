# Crossy Bruin

Endless-runner arcade game themed around UCLA, inspired by the popular mobile game "Crossy Road". Play as a student trying to get to class- avoid scooters, students, starships, and other obstacles to try and get across campus to make it to lecture!

This project was made by Andy Ren, Jeff Yue, and Roland Yang for Ashish Law's Spring 2025 CS174A: Introduction to Computer Graphics class at UCLA.
